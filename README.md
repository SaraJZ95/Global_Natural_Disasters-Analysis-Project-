# Analyzing Global Natural Disasters: A Historical Perspective

## Introduction:
Our study aims to analyze global natural disasters, spanning several decades, to understand their frequency, impact, and distribution. By leveraging historical data on various types of disasters, we aim to draw insights that can aid in better preparedness and response strategies.

## Data Overview:
The dataset we are working with is a comprehensive collection of disaster events from different countries over the years. Each row represents a unique disaster event, with columns capturing a range of information including the year, type, subtype, and impact metrics such as deaths, injuries, and economic damages. Here are some of the key columns in the dataset:
- **Year:** The year the disaster occurred.
- **Disaster Type:** Categorization of the disaster (e.g., Flood, Storm).
- **Total Deaths:** Number of deaths caused by the disaster.
- **Total Damages ('000 US$):** Economic impact measured in thousands of US dollars.
- **Total Affected:** Number of people affected by the disaster.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
To ensure the dataset is ready for analysis, several steps were taken:
1. **Handling Missing Values:** We inspected columns with missing values and decided on appropriate strategies to handle them, such as filling missing values with the mean, median, or dropping rows/columns as necessary.
2. **Converting Data Types:** Ensured that numerical columns are correctly typed and categorical columns are properly encoded.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created new features where necessary, such as calculating the economic impact per person affected.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
### 1. Temporal Analysis:
We started by analyzing the frequency of disasters over the years to understand trends and patterns. A line plot was created to visualize the number of disasters occurring each year.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting the number of disasters over the years
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
data['Year'].value_counts().sort_index().plot(kind='line')
plt.title('Number of Disasters Over the Years')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Disasters')
plt.show()
```

### 2. Distribution of Disaster Types:
Next, we examined the distribution of different types of disasters. A bar chart was created to show the frequency of each disaster type.

```python
# Plotting the distribution of disaster types
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
data['Disaster Type'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Distribution of Disaster Types')
plt.xlabel('Disaster Type')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

### 3. Impact Analysis:
We analyzed the impact of these disasters in terms of total deaths and economic damages. Scatter plots were created to visualize the relationship between the number of people affected and the total economic damage.

```python
# Scatter plot of total affected vs. total damages
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data['Total Affected'], data['Total Damages ('000 US$)'])
plt.title('Total Affected vs. Total Damages')
plt.xlabel('Total Affected')
plt.ylabel('Total Damages (000 US$)')
plt.show()
```

### 4. Geographical Analysis:
To understand the geographical distribution of disasters, we used latitude and longitude data to plot the locations of these events on a world map.

```python
import hvplot.pandas

# Plotting geographical distribution of disasters
data.hvplot.points('Longitude', 'Latitude', geo=True, tiles='OSM', 
                   size='Total Deaths', color='Disaster Type', 
                   hover_cols=['Disaster Type', 'Total Deaths', 'Total Damages (000 US$)'])
```

## Conclusion:
From our analysis, several key insights emerged:
1. **Increasing Frequency:** There has been an observable increase in the frequency of disasters over the years, which could be attributed to climate change and increased reporting.
2. **Predominant Disaster Types:** Storms and floods are the most frequent types of disasters, suggesting a need for targeted preparedness measures for these events.
3. **Significant Impact:** The economic damages from natural disasters are substantial, often running into billions of dollars, highlighting the need for robust economic safeguards and recovery plans.
4. **Geographical Hotspots:** Certain regions are more prone to specific types of disasters, underscoring the importance of localized disaster management strategies.
5. **Post-2021 Challenges (Not Covered in Our Data):** Although not captured in our dataset, the period after 2021 has been marked by unprecedented global challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which compounded the impact of natural disasters. The simultaneous occurrence of health crises and environmental catastrophes has stressed the need for integrated disaster response and recovery systems that can handle multiple concurrent emergencies.

By understanding these patterns and impacts, we can better prepare for future disasters and mitigate their effects on communities worldwide. This analysis serves as a foundation for further research and action in disaster management and preparedness.
